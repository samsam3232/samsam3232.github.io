**About me**

I am a PhD student in NLP under the supervision of the amazing [Prof. Jonathan Berant](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/) and [Prof. Aya Meltzer-Asscher](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/ameltzer) at [Tel-Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) in Israel. I mainly research Large Language Models (LLMs) under the scope of psycholinguistic theory, hoping to draw conclusions for both NLP and psycholinguistics.   
I am also an NLP research lead at [BlinqIO](https://blinq.io/)

**Additional research interests**

I began my academic journey in the [Adi Lautman Interdisciplinary Program for Outstanding Students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Lautman_Interdisciplinary_Program_for_Outstanding_Students) and I took classes in many faculties (mainly neurology, psychology, philosophy, biology but also economics, history, education...).    
My research interest are therefore diverse and I have a few ongoing projects apart from my main PhD research:
- A project in literature to improve creativity of LLMs (with the participation of the Israeli author Etgar Keret)
- Projects in economy/game theory 
I am always open to new collaborations and exploring new fields so feel free to reach out.
